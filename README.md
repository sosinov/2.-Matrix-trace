# Task 2. Matrix trace.

Users input matrix dimensions into the program (columns and lines).

Program fill matrix with random numbers (from 0 till 100 included).



Program should find a matrix trace.

Matrix trace is the sum of all elements on the main diagonal.

Main diagonal of the square matrix is the diagonal which starts in the top left corner and finishes in the bottom right corner.

Main diagonal for a rectangle matrix is the line, which starts in the top left corner and moves right and down, till the border (bottom or right) of the matrix.


Program should print the filled matrix into the console. Main diagonal should be highlighted.





Enhanced task (is not required, for students who feel in power to do):

Print to the console elements from the matrix going like snail shells from border to center.

Example

Input:

1 2 3 4

8 7 6 5

4 3 2 9

Output:

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 2, 3, 4, 8, 7, 6
